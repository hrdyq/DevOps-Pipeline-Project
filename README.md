# Campus Event Management Website

On modern college campuses, the coordination and promotion of events are often hindered by a lack of centralized event management systems. 

This results in low turnout, missed opportunities for student engagement, and inefficient allocation of university funds and resources. 

Students, faculty, and event organizers rely on fragmented platforms like social media (Instagram, Facebook, X, etc.), bulletin boards, posters, and email for event information, leading to communication breakdowns and a decrease in campus community participation.


To address these challenges, we propose the development of a Campus Event Management Application. 

This comprehensive platform will centralize event management, making it easier for students, faculty, and staff to discover, attend, and manage events.
